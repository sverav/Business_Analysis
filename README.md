# Business_Analysis
**Objective: Optimize marketing spend by analyzing customer behavior, acquisition costs, and revenue potential.**

- Data: Processed server logs (visits), orders, and marketing costs from 2017â€“2018.

- Key Metrics:

    - Visits: Daily/weekly/monthly active users, session duration, and retention rates.

    - Sales: Conversion time (0d, 1d), average order size, and customer lifetime value (LTV).

    - Marketing: Cost per acquisition (CPA) and return on marketing investment (ROMI) by source.

- Analysis:

    - Identified top-performing traffic sources (e.g., Source 3 had the highest conversions).

    - Calculated LTV to CPA ratios to assess profitability.

    - Visualizations: Created time-series plots for visit trends and bar charts for ROMI by source.

- Insights:

    - Mobile users converted faster (70% within 1 day) than desktop users.

    - Source 5 had the lowest CPA ($8) but moderate LTV, making it efficient for scaling.

    - Hypothesis Testing: Confirmed that shorter session durations (<5 mins) correlated with higher conversions.

- Recommendations:

     - Reallocate budget to Source 3 (highest ROMI) and mobile-targeted campaigns.

     - Reduce spend on underperforming sources (e.g., Source 1 with negative ROMI).

- Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning, visualization, and cohort analysis.

- Outcome: Delivered data-driven strategy to increase ROI by 25% and reduce wasted ad spend.

**Achievement: Empowered marketing team with actionable insights to refine targeting and budgeting. ðŸ“ŠðŸš€**
